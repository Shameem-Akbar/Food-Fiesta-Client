                                In React, controlled components refer to components that have their state and behavior controlled by the parent component. These components rely on props passed down from the parent component to update their state and behavior. Uncontrolled components refer to components that manage their own state internally.

                                <span className='fw-bold'>Ans: </span>
                                PropTypes define the type of a prop. So each time, a value is passed through a prop, it gets validated for itâ€™s type. If you pass a value through a prop with a different data type than it is specified in the PropTypes, an error message will be printed in the console of your browser

                                NodeJS is the package, which provides the JavaScript run-time environment, whereas Express is a framework that sits on top of NodeJS and helps us to handle requests and responses.

                                Custom React JS hooks offer reusability as when a custom hook is created, it can be reused easily, which makes the code cleaner and reduces the time to write the code.
